This is an attempt to run micropython on Intel Quark microcontrollers.

Current version uses the Edison MCU SDK 1.0.10 available from:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads

However, as of today the resulting intel_mcu.bin binary is tool large for
Edison's embedded Quark MCU:

# ls -sh /lib/firmware/intel_mcu.bin
   156 /lib/firmware/intel_mcu.bin
# echo "load mcu app" > /sys/devices/platform/intel_mcu/control
[ 3947.591804] psh fw size too big
